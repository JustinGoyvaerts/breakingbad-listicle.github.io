          </h1>
          <p>
            Walter is perhaps one of the best characters in any TV show, not
            solely Breaking Bad. An ordinary if repressed family man who faces
            lung cancer and the end of his life turns into one of America's most
            notorious criminals of all time. As the show progresses, viewers
            learn more and more about Walt's background, helping to make him
            more understandable. By the end of the show, Walt has alienated
            everybody against him and dies despite beating the cancer that set
            his personality shift off in the first place.

          <p>
            An electric character that was so good he was given his own
            spin-off, Saul Goodman is one of the best characters in Breaking
            Bad. The criminal lawyer of both Walt and Jesse, right from his
            entrance the character steals nearly every scene he's in and turns
            out to be an important part of Heisenberg's operation. Saul is a
            character with so much more to give even by the end of Breaking Bad.
            Even with so much mystery shrouding his past and why he is the way
            he is compared to other characters on the show, he still proves to
            be one of its best. There are plenty of Better Call Saul moments
            that add extra context to Breaking Badwhile also providing fans with
            more screentime with Jimmy.

          <h1><span>3.</span>Hank <span class="aka">ASAC</span> Schrader</h1>
          <p>
            Everyone's favorite DEA agent, Hank Schrader is a brilliant
            character who has some of the best scenes in Breaking Bad. Viewers
            saw him deal with Tuco, the Twins, and even Walt, Jesse, and the
            Neo-Nazi gang at one point. There are many who believe Hank should
            be the next character to get a Breaking Bad spin-off show. A funny
            character who's very larger-than-life, his near-misses discovering
            Walt provided a lot of drama throughout the seasons and eventually
            culminated in a big way.

          <h1><span>4.</span> Mike Ehrmantraut</h1>
          <p>
            Mike is one of the best characters across both Breaking Bad and
            Better Call Saul, owing to a brilliant, consistent performance by
            Jonathan Banks as well as brilliant characterization by the writing
            team. A bodyguard of Gus', Mike is responsible at many times for
            dealing with Walt and Jesse and feeding through information down by
            Gus. Over the course of the show we learn more of his backstory and
            that he's a former police officer who's only a criminal to pay for
            his granddaughter's future. This makes his ending all the more
            tragic in one of Breaking Bad's best episodes.

          </h1>
          <p>
            One of the main characters along with Walt, Jesse Pinkman is an
            interesting and layered character that goes onto cook meth with his
            high school chemistry teacher. More street smart than Walt, Jesse is
            often unfairly made to look like the sidekick to Walt. Jesse brings
            his own strengths to the duo and had many iconic moment across the
            show.

          <h1><span>6.</span>Gustavo Fring</h1>
          <p>
            One of the major villains of the Breaking Bad series, Gus Fring is a
            brilliant character who is one of the audience's favorite. Cunning,
            calculated, and unpredictable - Gus is one of the major players in
            Alburqueque's drug scene and employs Walt, Jesse, and Mike. There
            are so many great moments for the character over the course of the
            show with plenty of feuds with other characters. The character
            returned to Better Call Saul where he made a massive impact also.

          <h1><span>7.</span>Todd Alquist</h1>
          <p>
            Todd started off as a quiet, interested young man who didn't seem to
            pose any threat to Walt and Jesse despite being a pretty capable
            criminal. As time went on, Todd increasingly shows psychopathic
            signs and ended up being responsible, along with his Neo-Nazi
            family, for the prolonged torture of Jesse. Todd was a scary
            character for just how off he was, and was brilliant in his return
            in the El Camino movie.

          <h1><span>8.</span>Tuco Salamanca</h1>
          <p>
            Tuco was the first major villain of the Breaking Bad series and was
            frighteningly erratic. A meth user who had his own empire answering
            to the Mexican Cartel (made up of his family), he was Walt and
            Jesse's first look at the big time. Tuco eventually met his end
            after a shootout against Hank. His death was a shocking and
            unexpected one that left a vacuum in the criminal world, eventually
            being replaced by Walt and Jesse but also allowing Gus to maneuver
            his way into a stronger position.

          <h1><span>9.</span>Hector Salamanca</h1>
          <p>
            Hector Salamanca, also known as Don Hector and referred to as TÃ­o by
            his nephews, is the elderly don of the Cartel, and an associate of
            cartel boss Don Eladio Vuente and don Juan Bolsa. A member of the
            Salamanca family, Hector is the son of Abuelita, the uncle of twins
            Marco and Leonel, Lalo, and Tuco, and is the grandfather of Joaquin.
            He raised Tuco as a son, and taught him and his other nephews that
            family is everything, living by the creed himself. He is the second
            Salamanca family member to run their drug operation, following his
            nephew Tuco and was succeeded by his nephew Lalo. Though brutal,
            Hector is very loyal to his family and the cartel.

          <h1><span>10.</span>Marco & Leonel Salamanca</h1>
          <p>
            Marco and Leonel Salamanca, commonly known as The Cousins, are twin
            brothers, deadly enforcers, and prolific hitmen for Don Eladio
            Vuente's drug cartel. As members of the Salamanca family, the two
            cousins are grandsons of Abuelita and the nephews of Hector
            Salamanca. Marco and Leonel also have three cousins who are involved
            in criminal activities: Tuco, Lalo, and Joaquin. The Cousins'
            austere, mechanical physicality and virtually non-verbal interaction
            makes them a fearsome presence and they kill without hesitation or
            emotion.
